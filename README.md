# Custom Programming Devices

A collection of useful little helper boards and layouts.

##### FTDI USB Friend
A board derived from the Adafruit FTDI Friend. Uses the Mini-USB conductors to program an ATMega328. Ignores CTS Pin for that sake.

##### Mini USB Breakout
Exactly what it sounds like

##### Programming Headers
Special ISP Headers for Pogo Pins that allow for minimal routes and make it easier to create single-sided PCBs.
Matching Parts in my eagle library.

##### USB FTDI Connector
Similar to the FTDI USB Friend - but allows one to use standard FTDI Board.
